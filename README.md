Presenting the project  Grocery List to you!

Final Project
Although I'm making a lot of effort to fix the flaws, the Maps part of the app is currently not functioning as intended. As a result, I added a grocery list project to the same app, which is completely functional. You can check it out here. Excellent user interface and functionality.

Source Code (On My Repo) - Give ‚≠ê to the repo!
